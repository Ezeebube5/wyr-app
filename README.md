# Would You Rather Project
This project was created as part of Udacity's React Nanodegree.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This application was created with React and Redux to manage state. It allows users to create a question set to ask other users and poll for the results. User authentication and management is a mock implementation with user information created at application load time. Subsequent reloads of the site will require a new "login". The data is also created this way, so changes are not persisted between reloads (but are persisted while still within the application).

### Packages used:
    "@material-ui/core": "^4.10.0",
    "@material-ui/icons": "^4.9.1",
    "react": "^16.13.1",
    "react-dom": "^16.13.1",
    "react-redux": "^7.2.0",
    "react-redux-loading": "^4.6.1",

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
